                        Triton was created to address a gap in industry; a service provider that can identify affected stakeholder groups that pose a risk to pipelines. We provide damage prevention education to these stakeholders, measure outreach effectiveness and provide continual improvement opportunities to utility operators in the midstream space.

                        Our solutions create public awareness plans and we execute on these in order to effect positive behavioural changes of affected stakeholders to reduce pipeline damages.
